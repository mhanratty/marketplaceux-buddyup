		<h3>Design Directions</h3>
		<p class="longText">After the prototype and results of user testing the SUMO team and the Firefox OS team discussed the following design directions</p>
		
		<ul class="longText">
			<li><i>Live Help App</i> - Build a live help app within the settings app where users can contact community members or operator support agents for help.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Pros: Trained community members and operator support agents can give more expert advice vs. friends/family</li>
					<li>Cons: Difficulty in having enough community members/agents available in real-time to answer support requests, Scope of work to integrate with operator support systems, Not open enough for use cases outside of support</li>
				</ul>
			
			<li><i>Feature of Loop</i> - Incorporate screen sharing into Loop so that users can contact friends and contacts for help or other use cases.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Pros: Open to other uses cases than support, simplifies product/technology/maintenance by piggybacking on existing Firefox product/service</li>
					<li>Cons: Discoverability of feature if it only appears on Loop, not possible or difficult to explain screen sharing could be used for help (and other) use cases</li>
				</ul>
			
			
			<li><i>Screen sharing app</i> - Building a screen sharing only app that would allow users to use screen sharing for a variety of use cases including help</li>
			
				<ul>
					<li>Pros: Open to other uses cases than support, possible to explain screen sharing could be used for help (and other) use cases during app tutorial, Highly discoverable if it is a pre-loaded app on the phone</li>
					<li>Cons: Another app on the phone, Maintenance of app over long term</li>
				</ul>
			
		</ul>
		
		<p class="longText"><b>Addressing some concerns...</b></p>

		<ul class="longText">
			<li><i>Handling low number of support agents/community members</i></li>
				<ul>
					<li>Present alternative of asking contact as a fall back if no community member/support agents are available</li>
					<li>Instead of help at that moment, allow user to book a time with a community member like booking a time at the Apple genius bar. When the time happens community member/support agent will call the user.</li>
					<li>Only offer community member/support agent live help option in locales with large volunteer base</li>
					<li>Restrict live help times (9-5PM) and have community members/support agents sign-up for times</li>
				</ul>
			
			<li><i>Improving discoverability</i></li>
				<ul>
					<li>Live Help button in quick settings menu alongside options for airplane mode, wifi, etc.</li>
					<li>Creating app pre-loaded on the device that appears on the app grid</li>
					<li>Introducing features as part of 1st run experience. Replace tutorial with ability to connect to live help to receive tutorial.</li>
				</ul>
		</ul>
