		The SUMO team have been working on a concept for a live support help system for Firefox OS for over nine months. The Support team had several asynchronous ways of supporting Firefox OS users through a user guides, forums, etc. but believed that a live help solution would lead to higher satisfaction and resolution rates than asynchronous methods.
		</p>

		<p class="longText">The team had a functional specification (link) and executive summary (link). Some of the basic requirements for the service that they had come up with were:</p>
		<ul class="longText">
			
			<li>Real-time communication via chat</li>
			<li>Ability to trouble shoot the user's issue by showing the user how to resolve their issue (rather than telling)*</li>
			<li>Ability for community members to provide help to users</li>
		</ul>

		*For the last year Michelle Luna, Mobile & Firefox OS Support Manager, has helped her parents troubleshoot the Firefox OS phones they use as their primary mobile devices. Michelle realized that when she showed her parent how to do something on the phone her parent's ability to understand the issue and resolve it for themselves was much higher.

		<p><b>MWC demo prototype</b></p>
		<p class="longText">
		 Aubrey Anderson developed a prototype for MWC that allowed, through touch events, one Firefox OS device to control one or more other Firefox OS devices. At MWC a presenter could use their Firefox OS device to give a walkthrough and demo of the operating system to people with devices at the booth. A touch event on the controller’s phone triggered a touch event on the controlled phones. The controller could not see the other users’ screens. The MWC prototype was the starting point for the BuddyUp prototype and incorporates part of its codebase.

		 TogetherJS (https://togetherjs.com/) was a product built by the Mozilla Labs team. With TogetherJS a developer adds a javascript library and HTML snippet to their website that allow users to collaborate on the website in real time. One user invites one or more other people to the site by sharing the url of the site. The users can view the website together, see each other’s cursors and also use chat to communicate.
