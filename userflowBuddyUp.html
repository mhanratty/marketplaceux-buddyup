				<h3>Notes</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Prototype did not have invite sending. Instead a persistent "Start"/"End" button appeared at the top of the chat. </li>
					<li>Visual design of Helper app was different.</li>
					<li>There was no dedicated return to chat button in the Helper interface.</li>
					<li>Ending the chat did not send a survey to the person being helped.</li>
