		<p><b>How we can differentiate</b></p>
		<p class="longText">

		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Allow users to get help from friends and family rather than or in addition to support agents.</li>
		  	<li>Provide support via volunteer community members who are compensated with data credits or other rewards and recognition.</li>
			<li>Open up the ability to screen share and remotely control the mobile device to use cases beyond just live help, for example, co-browsing photos or playing a game together.</li>
			<li>Allow helper to remotely control the device in addition to annotating on screen.</li>
		</ul>
